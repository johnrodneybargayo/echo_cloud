# VerbiVibe

VerbiVibe is a responsive web application designed for real-time word clouds and interactive happiness scale visualizations. It enables users to submit words that dynamically build a word cloud, as well as participate in happiness level surveys. This application is optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile displays.

## Features

- **Real-Time Word Cloud**: Users can submit words, and the word cloud updates in real time based on frequency.
- **Happiness Level Survey**: Collects happiness levels from users with a dynamic, visually engaging scale.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage questions, reset the word cloud, and view submission statistics.
- **Question Manager**: Add, edit, and delete questions with an easy-to-use interface, organized in a 3x3 grid layout.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Fully responsive layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **User Authentication**: Google authentication allows users to log in, and their roles are automatically assigned (admin or participant).
- **Role Management**: Admin users can assign roles to users after authentication.
- **Database Reset**: Admin users can reset the word cloud and database data from the admin panel.
